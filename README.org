   Recently it got support for bitbucket repos also. No interface in
   firefox/chrome yet. To use it in conkeror, `m-x clone-repo` to
   clone (both bb or gh)

** Code
*** Browser
    In browser/org-protocol-github-lines.user.js theres the plugin
    that will insert the links on code comments that will link to
    emacs.

*** OS
    os/xdg-open Predefine org-protocol to open emacsclient

*** Emacs
    org-protocol-github-lines.el contains the code to open the actual file

** Conkeror
	 The js file for conkeror provides a command `m-x clone-repo` which
	 sends the signal to the emacs server to clone the
	 "repo-at-buffer". It works with both github and bitbucket.
